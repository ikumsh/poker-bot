# BIG BRAIN

For our final project at Makers Academy my team and I decided to make a bot to play Texas Hold 'Em Poker.
We were new to Java but we decided to dive in anyway.
We weren't sure what we could complete at first, and eventually we settled on writing a simple 1v1 game in pure Java.
All our code was written in Java, we used Swing for the GUI (Graphical User Interface) and tested using Maven JUnit (with close to 100% test coverage).
We did not use any API's and wrote BIG BRAIN 100% ourselves :)
